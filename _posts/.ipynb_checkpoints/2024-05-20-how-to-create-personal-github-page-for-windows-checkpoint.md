# Github Pages

Hello everyone! In this opportunity, I would like to share a technical process of creating personal/institutional github pages. Github pages itself is free and cool way for showing our resume, work and portofolio which is very beneficial for many purposes (e.g. applying for work, giving a teaching, building a network, etc.). Without further ado, let's go to the step-by-step in building our personalized github pages!

## 1. Install the Dependencies (see in CASA setup the Software)

- Windows PowerShell
- WSL
- Gem
- Ruby
- Bundler

## 2. Install Git and Create a Github Account

- Git
- Github

## 3. Fork a Theme Repository for Our Github Page

- See the theme repo libary (recommended for the starters: academic, netflix, or al-folio)
- Fork the repo
- change to our personalized username
- Display the pages in github (get the link)
- - select branch (main or docs)

## 4. Clone the Repository to the Local

- Select directory
- git clone

## 5. Set the _config.yml

- Change profile

## 6. Create and Edit Pages

- Creating a pages in _pages

## 7. Create and Edit Posts

- Creating a posts in posts

## 8. Push the Change to the Remote Repository (github.com) work with main and branch

- Git add .
- Git commit
- Git push

## 9. See the Change in Our username.github.io

- wait for about 5 minutes and refresh

## 10. Small Problem

- If we follow the procedure from github official website, we can do the change locally using exec. However, it is only applied for minima theme. When I changed the theme into something else, it cannot be rendered. That is why in this tutorial, I don't follow the official step, instead using the fast way which is compatible for the many themes.
