Inspired by [Milos Popovic's tutorial](https://milospopovic.net/3d-maps-with-r), I attempted to create a 3D visualization of the average Airbnb rental prices per night per 1 km2 in London in 2023. Interestingly, high prices seem to be located in the outskirts of London, contrary to the distribution of Airbnb locations in the city center.

My complete GitHub project for this map can be found [here] (https://github.com/ofitrahramadhan/3dmaps_R)
