During my investigation of carbon footprint data for a personal research project, I became intrigued by its correlation with population proportions. To explore this connection, I initiated the process by plotting both variables (carbon footprint vs population density) on bivariate maps.

Upon reviewing the maps, it seems that there isn't a consistent linear relationship (either positive or negative) between the variables. However, a notable spatial autocorrelation was apparent, indicating a systematic spatial distribution that goes beyond randomness. 

It's crucial to note that this observation is based solely on visualization, and further validation through statistics testing is advisable.
