Hello! I am a professional in the Urban Analytics domain with over six years of experience as a research and teaching assistant in the field. Currently, 
I am a master's student in Urban Spatial Science at University College London, 
focusing on deepening my expertise in the implementation of Big Data (e.g., satellite imagery, social media, and mobile phone data) and 
Machine Learning to enhance the analysis of Urban Resilience to Climate Change, 
particularly in coastal areas of Global South.
