HELLO!
I'm a postgraduate student at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London. 
My research interest focused on developing computational methods for urban planning in Global South, particularly in Indonesia. 
I sometimes build and write things for Diascholar, where I am a Research Fellow. 
I'm a big fan of satellites and strange datasets. Here are some of the projects and activities i've worked on over the years.


{% include base_path %}
{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
  {% if year != written_year %}
    <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %}
