Hello! I am a professional in the Urban Analytics domain with over six years of experience as a fellow researcher in the related field. 
Having just graduated from MSc in Urban Spatial Science from University College London, I am now focused on applying my expertise in the use of 
planet-scale satellite imagery and machine learning to estimate socio-economic information, 
inspired by (SOJA's Socio-Spatial Dialectic)[https://politicasexpositivas.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/soja-socio-spatial-dialectics.pdf], 
which benefits the urban planning process in countries of the Global South.
