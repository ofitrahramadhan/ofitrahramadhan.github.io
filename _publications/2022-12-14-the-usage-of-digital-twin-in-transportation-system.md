The Emerge of Digital Twin (DT) makes many changes to the life quality improvement, one of it is in how to manage the transportation systems. With DT, the current transportation systems have a great probability to become smarter. This research has a purpose to describe a variation of DT usage in transportation system. To achieve the targeted result, this research is using qualitative approach with code and network methods. 

Based on the analysis, there are three functions of DT in this domain. First, DT can be used to model the transportation system and find the best formula for optimizing it. Second, DT also can be used for conducting several policy scenarios (changing in the parameters). Lastly, DT can be used to monitor the quality of transport data that in to the model's algorithm.
